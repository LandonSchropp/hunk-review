# Hunk Review Loop

The user reviews changes in [Hunk](https://hunk.dev/), leaves comments, and presses a key to approve or deny. The `hunk-review` Hunk extension hands each decision to `hunk review listen`. Run `hunk review listen --help` for its options.

## Open the Review

Open Hunk where the user can see it, in a terminal tab or pane of its own, in the repository holding the changes:

```bash
hunk diff --watch
```

Use `hunk diff --staged --watch` to review only staged changes. `--watch` keeps the review current as you change files, so one Hunk session lasts across every round of review. Don't open a second one while it's running.

## Listen for Decisions

Run the listener under a tool that turns each line a background command prints into a notification, such as Claude Code's Monitor tool, with the longest timeout it allows:

```bash
hunk review listen --repo <directory>
```

Each decision arrives as its own line, `review-approved` or `review-denied`, whenever the user makes it. `review-closed` means the user closed the review. Re-arm the listener whenever it expires while the review is still open.

If the listener says several reviews are open, pass `--session` with the ID of the one you opened: the newest in `hunk session list --json` for that repository.

## Act on a Decision

Read the review's comments after every decision, approve or deny:

```bash
hunk session comment list --repo <directory> --type all --json
```

Act on the user's comments that don't have a reply from you yet. The rest were handled in an earlier round.

- **Deny:** Address the comments, then wait for the next decision. Don't treat the work as accepted until an approval arrives.
- **Approve:** The changes are accepted. Make any small fixes the comments ask for without another review.

Reply to every comment you handle, so the next round can tell it's done: confirm the change, push back instead of making it, or add context alongside it.

```bash
hunk session comment add --repo <directory> --reply-to <comment-id> --summary "<reply>"
```

## Rationalizations

| Thought                                            | Reality                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Approved, so there's nothing to read"             | Approvals can carry comments. Read them every time.                 |
| "I'll ask the user whether they're done reviewing" | The decision arrives on its own. Wait for it.                       |
| "I'll reopen Hunk for the next round"              | `--watch` already shows the new changes. Keep the one session open. |
